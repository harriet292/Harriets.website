  How it all started
    </h2>
<p>
    It’s difficult to put an exact date on when gymnastics started, but many experts think it originated in ancient Greece – about 2500 years ago!<br>

It’s thought that the purpose for gymnastics training during this time was to prepare young men for war.<br>

At the time, the gyms that the Greeks trained in were not only for physical education, but also for training their brains (a bit like schools today)!<br>

In ancient gymnastics, the sport looked a lot different than it does today and covered a wide range of activities that have since branched out into other sports such as wrestling and athletics events.<br>
